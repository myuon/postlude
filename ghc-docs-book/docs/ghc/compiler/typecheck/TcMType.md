Monadic type operations

This module contains monadic operations over types that contain
mutable type variables


# Kind variables


# Evidence variables; range over constraints we can abstract over


# Coercion holes


# Expected types


### Note: ExpType


An ExpType is used as the "expected type" when type-checking an expression.
An ExpType can hold a "hole" that can be filled in by the type-checker.
This allows us to have one tcExpr that works in both checking mode and
synthesis mode (that is, bidirectional type-checking). Previously, this
was achieved by using ordinary unification variables, but we don't need
or want that generality. (For example, #11397 was caused by doing the
wrong thing with unification variables.) Instead, we observe that these
holes should

1. never be nested
2. never appear as the type of a variable
3. be used linearly (never be duplicated)

By defining ExpType, separately from Type, we can achieve goals 1 and 2
statically.

### Note: TcLevel of ExpType

Consider

  data G a where
    MkG :: G Bool

  foo MkG = True

### Note: Case branches must never infer a non-tau type



# SkolemTvs (immutable)


### Note: Kind substitution when instantiating

When we instantiate a bunch of kind and type variables, first we
expect them to be topologically sorted.
Then we have to instantiate the kind variables, build a substitution
from old variables to the new variables, then instantiate the type
variables substituting the original kind.

Exemple: If we want to instantiate
  [(k1 :: *), (k2 :: *), (a :: k1 -> k2), (b :: k1)]
we want
  [(?k1 :: *), (?k2 :: *), (?a :: ?k1 -> ?k2), (?b :: ?k1)]
instead of the buggous
  [(?k1 :: *), (?k2 :: *), (?a :: k1 -> k2), (?b :: k1)]

# MetaTvs: TauTvs


### Note: Never need to instantiate coercion variables

With coercion variables sloshing around in types, it might seem that we
sometimes need to instantiate coercion variables. This would be problematic,
because coercion variables inhabit unboxed equality (~#), and the constraint
solver thinks in terms only of boxed equality (~). The solution is that
we never need to instantiate coercion variables in the first place.

The tyvars that we need to instantiate come from the types of functions,
data constructors, and patterns. These will never be quantified over
coercion variables, except for the special case of the promoted Eq#. But,
that can't ever appear in user code, so we're safe!


### Note: Name of an instantiated type variable

At the moment we give a unification variable a System Name, which
influences the way it is tidied; see TypeRep.tidyTyVarBndr.


# Quantification


### Note: quantifyTyVars

quantifyTyVars is given the free vars of a type that we
are about to wrap in a forall.

It takes these free type/kind variables (partitioned into dependent and
non-dependent variables) and
  1. Zonks them and remove globals and covars
  2. Extends kvs1 with free kind vars in the kinds of tvs (removing globals)
  3. Calls zonkQuantifiedTyVar on each

Step (2) is often unimportant, because the kind variable is often
also free in the type.  Eg
     Typeable k (a::k)
has free vars {k,a}.  But the type (see Trac #7916)
    (f::k->*) (a::k)
has free vars {f,a}, but we must add 'k' as well! Hence step (3).

* This function distinguishes between dependent and non-dependent
  variables only to keep correct defaulting behavior with -XNoPolyKinds.
  With -XPolyKinds, it treats both classes of variables identically.

* quantifyTyVars never quantifies over
    - a coercion variable
    - a runtime-rep variable

### Note: quantifyTyVars determinism

The results of quantifyTyVars are wrapped in a forall and can end up in the
interface file. One such example is inferred type signatures. They also affect
the results of optimizations, for example worker-wrapper. This means that to
get deterministic builds quantifyTyVars needs to be deterministic.

To achieve this CandidatesQTvs is backed by deterministic sets which allows them
to be later converted to a list in a deterministic order.

### Note: Deterministic UniqFM

### Note: Defaulting with -XNoPolyKinds

Consider

  data Compose f g a = Mk (f (g a))

We infer

  Compose :: forall k1 k2. (k2 -> *) -> (k1 -> k2) -> k1 -> *
  Mk :: forall k1 k2 (f :: k2 -> *) (g :: k1 -> k2) (a :: k1).
        f (g a) -> Compose k1 k2 f g a

Now, in another module, we have -XNoPolyKinds -XDataKinds in effect.
What does 'Mk mean? Pre GHC-8.0 with -XNoPolyKinds,
we just defaulted all kind variables to *. But that's no good here,
because the kind variables in 'Mk aren't of kind *, so defaulting to *
is ill-kinded.

After some debate on #11334, we decided to issue an error in this case.
The code is in defaultKindVar.

### Note: What is a meta variable?

A "meta type-variable", also know as a "unification variable" is a placeholder
introduced by the typechecker for an as-yet-unknown monotype.

For example, when we see a call `reverse (f xs)`, we know that we calling
    reverse :: forall a. [a] -> [a]
So we know that the argument `f xs` must be a "list of something". But what is
the "something"? We don't know until we explore the `f xs` a bit more. So we set
out what we do know at the call of `reverse` by instantiate its type with a fresh
meta tyvar, `alpha` say. So now the type of the argument `f xs`, and of the
result, is `[alpha]`. The unification variable `alpha` stands for the
as-yet-unknown type of the elements of the list.

As type inference progresses we may learn more about `alpha`. For example, suppose
`f` has the type
    f :: forall b. b -> [Maybe b]
Then we instantiate `f`'s type with another fresh unification variable, say
`beta`; and equate `f`'s result type with reverse's argument type, thus
`[alpha] ~ [Maybe beta]`.

Now we can solve this equality to learn that `alpha ~ Maybe beta`, so we've
refined our knowledge about `alpha`. And so on.

If you found this Note useful, you may also want to have a look at
Section 5 of "Practical type inference for higher rank types" (Peyton Jones,
Vytiniotis, Weirich and Shields. J. Functional Programming. 2011).

### Note: What is zonking?

GHC relies heavily on mutability in the typechecker for efficient operation.
For this reason, throughout much of the type checking process meta type
variables (the MetaTv constructor of TcTyVarDetails) are represented by mutable
variables (known as TcRefs).

Zonking is the process of ripping out these mutable variables and replacing them
with a real Type. This involves traversing the entire type expression, but the
interesting part of replacing the mutable variables occurs in zonkTyVarOcc.

There are two ways to zonk a Type:

 * zonkTcTypeToType, which is intended to be used at the end of type-checking
   for the final zonk. It has to deal with unfilled metavars, either by filling
   it with a value like Any or failing (determined by the UnboundTyVarZonker
   used).

 * zonkTcType, which will happily ignore unfilled metavars. This is the
   appropriate function to use while in the middle of type-checking.

### Note: Zonking to Skolem

We used to zonk quantified type variables to regular TyVars.  However, this
leads to problems.  Consider this program from the regression test suite:

  eval :: Int -> String -> String -> String
  eval 0 root actual = evalRHS 0 root actual

  evalRHS :: Int -> a
  evalRHS 0 root actual = eval 0 root actual

It leads to the deferral of an equality (wrapped in an implication constraint)

  forall a. () => ((String -> String -> String) ~ a)

which is propagated up to the toplevel (see TcSimplify.tcSimplifyInferCheck).
In the meantime `a' is zonked and quantified to form `evalRHS's signature.
This has the *side effect* of also zonking the `a' in the deferred equality
(which at this point is being handed around wrapped in an implication
constraint).

Finally, the equality (with the zonked `a') will be handed back to the
simplifier by TcRnDriver.tcRnSrcDecls calling TcSimplify.tcSimplifyTop.
If we zonk `a' with a regular type variable, we will have this regular type
variable now floating around in the simplifier, which in many places assumes to
only see proper TcTyVars.

We can avoid this problem by zonking with a skolem.  The skolem is rigid
(which we require for a quantified variable), but is still a TcTyVar that the
simplifier knows how to deal with.

### Note: Silly Type Synonyms

Consider this:
        type C u a = u  -- Note 'a' unused

        foo :: (forall a. C u a -> C u a) -> u
        foo x = ...

        bar :: Num u => u
        bar = foo (\t -> t + t)

* From the (\t -> t+t) we get type  {Num d} =>  d -> d
  where d is fresh.

* Now unify with type of foo's arg, and we get:
        {Num (C d a)} =>  C d a -> C d a
  where a is fresh.

* Now abstract over the 'a', but float out the Num (C d a) constraint
  because it does not 'really' mention a.  (see exactTyVarsOfType)
  The arg to foo becomes
        \/\a -> \t -> t+t

* So we get a dict binding for Num (C d a), which is zonked to give
        a = ()
  [Note Sept 04: now that we are zonking quantified type variables
  on construction, the 'a' will be frozen as a regular tyvar on
  quantification, so the floated dict will still have type (C d a).
  Which renders this whole note moot; happily!]

* Then the \/\a abstraction has a zonked 'a' in it.

All very silly.   I think its harmless to ignore the problem.  We'll end up with
a \/\a in the final result but all the occurrences of a will be zonked to ()

# Zonking types




# Zonking constraints


### Note: zonkCt behaviour

zonkCt tries to maintain the canonical form of a Ct.  For example,
  - a CDictCan should stay a CDictCan;
  - a CTyEqCan should stay a CTyEqCan (if the LHS stays as a variable.).
  - a CHoleCan should stay a CHoleCan
  - a CIrredCan should stay a CIrredCan with its cc_insol flag intact

Why?, for example:
- For CDictCan, the @TcSimplify.expandSuperClasses@ step, which runs after the
  simple wanted and plugin loop, looks for @CDictCan@s. If a plugin is in use,
  constraints are zonked before being passed to the plugin. This means if we
  don't preserve a canonical form, @expandSuperClasses@ fails to expand
  superclasses. This is what happened in Trac #11525.

- For CHoleCan, once we forget that it's a hole, we can never recover that info.

- For CIrredCan we want to see if a constraint is insoluble with insolubleWC

NB: we do not expect to see any CFunEqCans, because zonkCt is only
called on unflattened constraints.

NB: Constraints are always re-flattened etc by the canonicaliser in
@TcCanonical@ even if they come in as CDictCan. Only canonical constraints that
are actually in the inert set carry all the guarantees. So it is okay if zonkCt
creates e.g. a CDictCan where the cc_tyars are /not/ function free.
