# Renaming of expressions

Basically dependency analysis.

Handles @Match@, @GRHSs@, @HsExpr@, and @Qualifier@ datatypes.  In
general, all of these functions return a renamed thing, and a set of
free variables.


# \subsubsection{Expressions}



These three are pattern syntax appearing in expressions.
Since all the symbols are reservedops we can simply reject them.
We return a (bogus) EWildPat in each case.


# Static values


### Note: Grand plan for static forms

# Arrow notation


# Arrow commands


# Arithmetic sequences


# \subsubsection{@Stmt@s: in @do@ expressions}


### Note: Deterministic ApplicativeDo and RecursiveDo desugaring

Both ApplicativeDo and RecursiveDo need to create tuples not
present in the source text.

For ApplicativeDo we create:

  (a,b,c) <- (\c b a -> (a,b,c)) <$>

For RecursiveDo we create:

  mfix (\ ~(a,b,c) -> do ...; return (a',b',c'))

### Note: Deterministic UniqFM

### Note: Failing pattern matches in Stmts


Many things desugar to HsStmts including monadic things like `do` and `mdo`
statements, pattern guards, and list comprehensions (see 'HsStmtContext' for an
exhaustive list). How we deal with pattern match failure is context-dependent.

 * In the case of list comprehensions and pattern guards we don't need any 'fail'
   function; the desugarer ignores the fail function field of 'BindStmt' entirely.
 * In the case of monadic contexts (e.g. monad comprehensions, do, and mdo
   expressions) we want pattern match failure to be desugared to the appropriate
   'fail' function (either that of Monad or MonadFail, depending on whether
   -XMonadFailDesugaring is enabled.)

At one point we failed to make this distinction, leading to #11216.


### Note: Renaming parallel Stmts

Renaming parallel statements is painful.  Given, say
     [ a+c | a <- as, bs <- bss
           | c <- bs, a <- ds ]
Note that
  (a) In order to report "Defined but not used" about 'bs', we must
      rename each group of Stmts with a thing_inside whose FreeVars
      include at least {a,c}

  (b) We want to report that 'a' is illegally bound in both branches

  (c) The 'bs' in the second group must obviously not be captured by
      the binding in the first group

To satisfy (a) we nest the segements.
To satisfy (b) we check for duplicates just before thing_inside.
To satisfy (c) we reset the LocalRdrEnv each time.

# \subsubsection{mdo expressions}


### Note: Segmenting mdo

NB. June 7 2012: We only glom segments that appear in an explicit mdo;
and leave those found in "do rec"'s intact.  See
http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/4148 for the discussion
leading to this design choice.  Hence the test in segmentRecStmts.

### Note: Glomming segments

Glomming the singleton segments of an mdo into minimal recursive groups.

At first I thought this was just strongly connected components, but
there's an important constraint: the order of the stmts must not change.

Consider
     mdo { x <- ...y...
           p <- z
           y <- ...x...
           q <- x
           z <- y
           r <- x }

Here, the first stmt mention 'y', which is bound in the third.
But that means that the innocent second stmt (p <- z) gets caught
up in the recursion.  And that in turn means that the binding for
'z' has to be included... and so on.

Start at the tail { r <- x }
Now add the next one { z <- y ; r <- x }
Now add one more     { q <- x ; z <- y ; r <- x }
Now one more... but this time we have to group a bunch into rec
     { rec { y <- ...x... ; q <- x ; z <- y } ; r <- x }
Now one more, which we can add on without a rec
     { p <- z ;
       rec { y <- ...x... ; q <- x ; z <- y } ;
       r <- x }
Finally we add the last one; since it mentions y we have to
glom it together with the first two groups
     { rec { x <- ...y...; p <- z ; y <- ...x... ;
             q <- x ; z <- y } ;
       r <- x }


# ApplicativeDo


### Note: ApplicativeDo

= Example =

For a sequence of statements

 do
     x <- A
     y <- B x
     z <- C
     return (f x y z)

We want to transform this to

  (\(x,y) z -> f x y z) <$> (do x <- A; y <- B x; return (x,y)) <*> C

It would be easy to notice that "y <- B x" and "z <- C" are
independent and do something like this:

 do
     x <- A
     (y,z) <- (,) <$> B x <*> C
     return (f x y z)

But this isn't enough! A and C were also independent, and this
transformation loses the ability to do A and C in parallel.

The algorithm works by first splitting the sequence of statements into
independent "segments", and a separate "tail" (the final statement). In
our example above, the segements would be

     [ x <- A
     , y <- B x ]

     [ z <- C ]

and the tail is:

     return (f x y z)

Then we take these segments and make an Applicative expression from them:

     (\(x,y) z -> return (f x y z))
       <$> do { x <- A; y <- B x; return (x,y) }
       <*> C

Finally, we recursively apply the transformation to each segment, to
discover any nested parallelism.

= Syntax & spec =

  expr ::= ... | do {stmt_1; ..; stmt_n} expr | ...

  stmt ::= pat <- expr
         | (arg_1 | ... | arg_n)  -- applicative composition, n>=1
         | ...                    -- other kinds of statement (e.g. let)

  arg ::= pat <- expr
        | {stmt_1; ..; stmt_n} {var_1..var_n}

(note that in the actual implementation,the expr in a do statement is
represented by a LastStmt as the final stmt, this is just a
representational issue and may change later.)

== Transformation to introduce applicative stmts ==

ado {} tail = tail
ado {pat <- expr} {return expr'} = (mkArg(pat <- expr)); return expr'
ado {one} tail = one : tail
ado stmts tail
  | n == 1 = ado before (ado after tail)
    where (before,after) = split(stmts_1)
  | n > 1  = (mkArg(stmts_1) | ... | mkArg(stmts_n)); tail
  where
    {stmts_1 .. stmts_n} = segments(stmts)

segments(stmts) =
  -- divide stmts into segments with no interdependencies

mkArg({pat <- expr}) = (pat <- expr)
mkArg({stmt_1; ...; stmt_n}) =
  {stmt_1; ...; stmt_n} {vars(stmt_1) u .. u vars(stmt_n)}

split({stmt_1; ..; stmt_n) =
  ({stmt_1; ..; stmt_i}, {stmt_i+1; ..; stmt_n})
  -- 1 <= i <= n
  -- i is a good place to insert a bind

== Desugaring for do ==

dsDo {} expr = expr

dsDo {pat <- rhs; stmts} expr =
   rhs >>= \pat -> dsDo stmts expr

dsDo {(arg_1 | ... | arg_n)} (return expr) =
  (\argpat (arg_1) .. argpat(arg_n) -> expr)
     <$> argexpr(arg_1)
     <*> ...
     <*> argexpr(arg_n)

dsDo {(arg_1 | ... | arg_n); stmts} expr =
  join (\argpat (arg_1) .. argpat(arg_n) -> dsDo stmts expr)
     <$> argexpr(arg_1)
     <*> ...
     <*> argexpr(arg_n)



### Note: ApplicativeDo and strict patterns

A strict pattern match is really a dependency.  For example,

do
  (x,y) <- A
  z <- B
  return C

The pattern (_,_) must be matched strictly before we do B.  If we
allowed this to be transformed into

  (\(x,y) -> \z -> C) <$> A <*> B

then it could be lazier than the standard desuraging using >>=.  See #13875
for more examples.

Thus, whenever we have a strict pattern match, we treat it as a
dependency between that statement and the following one.  The
dependency prevents those two statements from being performed "in
parallel" in an ApplicativeStmt, but doesn't otherwise affect what we
can do with the rest of the statements in the same "do" expression.
