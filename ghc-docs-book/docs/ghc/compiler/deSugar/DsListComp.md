Desugaring list comprehensions, monad comprehensions and array comprehensions



List comprehensions may be desugared in one of two ways: ``ordinary''
(as you would expect if you read SLPJ's book) and ``with foldr/build
turned on'' (if you read Gill {\em et al.}'s paper on the subject).

There will be at least one ``qualifier'' in the input.


# \subsection[DsListComp-ordinary]{Ordinary desugaring of list comprehensions}


Just as in Phil's chapter~7 in SLPJ, using the rules for
optimally-compiled list comprehensions.  This is what Kevin followed
as well, and I quite happily do the same.  The TQ translation scheme
transforms a list of qualifiers (either boolean expressions or
generators) into a single expression which implements the list
comprehension.  Because we are generating 2nd-order polymorphic
lambda-calculus, calls to NIL and CONS must be applied to a type
argument, as well as their usual value arguments.
\begin{verbatim}
TE << [ e | qs ] >>  =  TQ << [ e | qs ] ++ Nil (typeOf e) >>

(Rule C)
TQ << [ e | ] ++ L >> = Cons (typeOf e) TE <<e>> TE <<L>>

(Rule B)
TQ << [ e | b , qs ] ++ L >> =
    if TE << b >> then TQ << [ e | qs ] ++ L >> else TE << L >>

(Rule A')
TQ << [ e | p <- L1, qs ]  ++  L2 >> =
  letrec
    h = \ u1 ->
          case u1 of
            []        ->  TE << L2 >>
            (u2 : u3) ->
                  (( \ TE << p >> -> ( TQ << [e | qs]  ++  (h u3) >> )) u2)
                    [] (h u3)
  in
    h ( TE << L1 >> )

"h", "u1", "u2", and "u3" are new variables.
\end{verbatim}

@deListComp@ is the TQ translation scheme.  Roughly speaking, @dsExpr@
is the TE translation scheme.  Note that we carry around the @L@ list
already desugared.  @dsListComp@ does the top TE rule mentioned above.

To the above, we add an additional rule to deal with parallel list
comprehensions.  The translation goes roughly as follows:
     [ e | p1 <- e11, let v1 = e12, p2 <- e13
         | q1 <- e21, let v2 = e22, q2 <- e23]
     =>
     [ e | ((x1, .., xn), (y1, ..., ym)) <-
               zip [(x1,..,xn) | p1 <- e11, let v1 = e12, p2 <- e13]
                   [(y1,..,ym) | q1 <- e21, let v2 = e22, q2 <- e23]]
where (x1, .., xn) are the variables bound in p1, v1, p2
      (y1, .., ym) are the variables bound in q1, v2, q2

In the translation below, the ParStmt branch translates each parallel branch
into a sub-comprehension, and desugars each independently.  The resulting lists
are fed to a zip function, we create a binding for all the variables bound in all
the comprehensions, and then we hand things off the the desugarer for bindings.
The zip function is generated here a) because it's small, and b) because then we
don't have to deal with arbitrary limits on the number of zip functions in the
prelude, nor which library the zip function came from.
The introduced tuples are Boxed, but only because I couldn't get it to work
with the Unboxed variety.


# \subsection[DsListComp-foldr-build]{Foldr/Build desugaring of list comprehensions}


@dfListComp@ are the rules used with foldr/build turned on:

\begin{verbatim}
TE[ e | ]            c n = c e n
TE[ e | b , q ]      c n = if b then TE[ e | q ] c n else n
TE[ e | p <- l , q ] c n = let
                                f = \ x b -> case x of
                                                  p -> TE[ e | q ] c b
                                                  _ -> b
                           in
                           foldr f n l
\end{verbatim}
