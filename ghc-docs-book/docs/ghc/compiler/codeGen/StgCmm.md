 'cgTopBinding' is only used for top-level bindings, since they need
to be allocated statically (not in the heap) and need to be labelled.
No unboxed bindings can happen at top level.

In the code below, the static bindings are accumulated in the
@MkCgState@, and transferred into the ``statics'' slot by @forkStatics@.
This is so that we can write the top level processing in a compositional
style, with the increasing static environment being plumbed as a state
variable.
