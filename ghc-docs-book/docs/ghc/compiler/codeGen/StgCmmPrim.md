### Note: Foreign call results

A foreign call always returns an unboxed tuple of results, one
of which is the state token.  This seems to happen even for pure
calls.

Even if we returned a single result for pure calls, it'd still be
right to wrap it in a singleton unboxed tuple, because the result
might be a Haskell closure pointer, we don't want to evaluate it.

 Freezing arrays-of-ptrs requires changing an info table, for the
   benefit of the generational collector.  It needs to scavenge mutable
   objects, even if they are in old space.  When they become immutable,
   they can be removed from this scavenge list.  


   With some bit-twiddling, we can define int{Add,Sub}Czh portably in
   C, and without needing any comparisons.  This may not be the
   fastest way to do it - if you have better code, please send it! --SDM

   Return : r = a + b,  c = 0 if no overflow, 1 on overflow.

   We currently don't make use of the r value if c is != 0 (i.e.
   overflow), we just convert to big integers and try again.  This
   could be improved by making r and c the correct values for
   plugging into a new J#.

   { r = ((I_)(a)) + ((I_)(b));                                 \
     c = ((StgWord)(~(((I_)(a))^((I_)(b))) & (((I_)(a))^r)))    \
         >> (BITS_IN (I_) - 1);                                 \
   }
   Wading through the mass of bracketry, it seems to reduce to:
   c = ( (~(a^b)) & (a^r) ) >>unsigned (BITS_IN(I_)-1)



 Similarly:
   #define subIntCzh(r,c,a,b)                                   \
   { r = ((I_)(a)) - ((I_)(b));                                 \
     c = ((StgWord)((((I_)(a))^((I_)(b))) & (((I_)(a))^r)))     \
         >> (BITS_IN (I_) - 1);                                 \
   }

   c =  ((a^b) & (a^r)) >>unsigned (BITS_IN(I_)-1)
