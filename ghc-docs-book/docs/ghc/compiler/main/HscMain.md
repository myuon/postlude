                   --------------------------------
                        The compilation proper
                   --------------------------------

It's the task of the compilation proper to compile Haskell, hs-boot and core
files to either byte-code, hard-code (C, asm, LLVM, etc.) or to nothing at all
(the module is still parsed and type-checked. This feature is mostly used by
IDE's and the likes). Compilation can happen in either 'one-shot', 'batch',
'nothing', or 'interactive' mode. 'One-shot' mode targets hard-code, 'batch'
mode targets hard-code, 'nothing' mode targets nothing and 'interactive' mode
targets byte-code.

The modes are kept separate because of their different types and meanings:

 * In 'one-shot' mode, we're only compiling a single file and can therefore
 discard the new ModIface and ModDetails. This is also the reason it only
 targets hard-code; compiling to byte-code or nothing doesn't make sense when
 we discard the result.

 * 'Batch' mode is like 'one-shot' except that we keep the resulting ModIface
 and ModDetails. 'Batch' mode doesn't target byte-code since that require us to
 return the newly compiled byte-code.

 * 'Nothing' mode has exactly the same type as 'batch' mode but they're still
 kept separate. This is because compiling to nothing is fairly special: We
 don't output any interface files, we don't run the simplifier and we don't
 generate any code.

 * 'Interactive' mode is similar to 'batch' mode except that we return the
 compiled byte-code together with the ModIface and ModDetails.

Trying to compile a hs-boot file to byte-code will result in a run-time error.
This is the only thing that isn't caught by the type-system.

When the UnlinkedBCOExpr is linked you get an HValue of type *IO [HValue]* When
you run it you get a list of HValues that should be the same length as the list
of names; add them to the ClosureEnv.

### Note: Fixity declarations in GHCi


  To support fixity declarations on types defined within GHCi (as requested
  in #10018) we record the fixity environment in InteractiveContext.
  When we want to evaluate something TcRnDriver.runTcInteractive pulls out this
  fixity environment and uses it to initialize the global typechecker environment.
  After the typechecker has finished its business, an updated fixity environment
  (reflecting whatever fixity declarations were present in the statements we
  passed it) will be returned from hscParsedStmt. This is passed to
  updateFixityEnv, which will stuff it back into InteractiveContext, to be
  used in evaluating the next statement.
